# Class "LevelGenerator"

???+ info
    This class gives access to the level generator, the tool that generates a floor.
    
    This class cannot be instantiated. The only way to access it is through callback parameters.

    * [MC_POST_LEVEL_LAYOUT_GENERATED](enums/ModCallbacks.md#mc_post_level_layout_generated)

## Functions

<div class="rgon-only" markdown="1">

### GetAllRooms () {: aria-label='Functions' }
#### [LevelGeneratorRoom](LevelGeneratorRoom.md)[] GetAllRooms ( ) [ ](#){: .rgonorplus .tooltip .badge } {: .copyable aria-label='Functions' }
Returns a table of [LevelGeneratorRoom](LevelGeneratorRoom.md) representing all the rooms that have been generated so far.

### GetDeadEnds () {: aria-label='Functions' }
#### [LevelGeneratorRoom](LevelGeneratorRoom.md)[] GetDeadEnds ( ) [ ](#){: .rgonorplus .tooltip .badge } {: .copyable aria-label='Functions' }
Returns a table of [LevelGeneratorRoom](LevelGeneratorRoom.md) representing all the dead end rooms that have been generated so far.

### GetNonDeadEnds () {: aria-label='Functions' }
#### [LevelGeneratorRoom](LevelGeneratorRoom.md)[] GetNonDeadEnds ( ) [ ](#){: .rgonorplus .tooltip .badge } {: .copyable aria-label='Functions' }
Returns a table of [LevelGeneratorRoom](LevelGeneratorRoom.md) representing all the non-dead-end rooms that have been generated so far.

### PlaceRoom () {: aria-label='Functions' }
#### int PlaceRoom ( int Column, int Row, [RoomShape](https://wofsauge.github.io/IsaacDocs/rep/enums/RoomShape.html) Shape, [LevelGeneratorRoom](LevelGeneratorRoom.md) Origin ) [ ](#){: .rgonorplus .tooltip .badge } {: .copyable aria-label='Functions' }
Place a [LevelGeneratorRoom](LevelGeneratorRoom.md) object onto the level grid.
The `Origin` parameter is used as the index of the connecting room. For instance, if you want to place a room on top of the starting room, then `Origin` can be the starting room of the floor.
The column and row values need to be between `0` and `12` (inclusive).
Returns the GenerationIndex of the placed room. If placement was not possible, returns nil.

???+ note "Multiple origins"
    When placing a room, you may wonder which of its neighbors must act as the origin. This affects the placement of special
    rooms, as the game places special rooms in a specific order based on the distance between each dead-end room and the start of the floor.
    The `Origin` parameter is used to ensure consistency with the existing rooms. During the generation phase, the game always picks a room
    and starts placing rooms around it. This parameter reflects this behavior.
    The distance from the start of the floor to the new room is equal to the distance from the start of the floor to `Origin`, plus one.
    In practice, you are free to choose any neighboring room as a point of origin.
